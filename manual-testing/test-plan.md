## 1. Overview
This test plan describes the scope, strategy, resources, and schedule for testing the backup application across Windows and Linux environments.

## 2. Objectives
- Ensure application performs backups successfully across platforms
- Verify API endpoints and system responses
- Validate user interface behavior through automated tests
- Identify critical bugs before release

## 3. Scope
### In Scope:
- Manual functional testing
- API testing via Postman
- UI automation (Selenium)
- DNS/DHCP configuration checks

### Out of Scope:
- Performance and load testing
- Security penetration testing

## 4. Test Items
- Backup functionality (incremental, full)
- Restore functionality
- API (GET, POST requests)
- System configuration validations

## 5. Testing Types
